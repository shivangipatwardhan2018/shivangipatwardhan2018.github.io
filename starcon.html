        <h3>StarCon! Day 1</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.starcon.io">StarCon</a> was a two day software engineering conference held at the University of Waterloo on January 6th &amp; 7th, 2018. The two days were filled with fifteen minutes lighting talks focusing on a varied array of technical topics. The soul of the conference was to motivate and encourage individuals to be excited about technology and learn about a field within technology they did not know before. </p>
<p>The keynote on the first day was presented by <a href="https://jvns.ca/">Julia Evans</a>, a programming wizard! Titled <a href="https://jvns.ca/wizard-zine.pdf">"So you want to be a wizard?"</a>, the keynote consisted of a comprehensive toolbox of tips, tricks and hints of being a coding wizard. The greatest highlight of the talk was that there was no target audience, anyone from a novice coder to the industry veteran could learn and relate. </p>
<p>For me, two most important take-aways from the keynote were (1) How to ask good questions and (2) How to read source code. Asking questions is such a HUGE part of being and becoming a good software developer and as with any other skills it takes practice and experience. Julia greatly emphasized demonstrating that you have invested time in the problem and first stating what you know. Then begin by asking a detailed question about a specific unit of technology; slowing working your way from the details to the larger picture really helps to foster a good educational conversation with others. </p>
<p>There is often a prevalent misunderstanding that asking questions makes people looks stupid, working in the technology industry for a year now, I have come to realize this is not true. Asking questions and asking good question shows that you are inquisitively thinking about the problem at hand and most importantly that you are learning. Apart from asking good questions, it very important to ask question in public especially as one slowly becomes a more senior member of team. </p>
<p>Coding is an art-form each individual has a unique way of designing their code, and as with interpreting art, interpreting code takes practice. One of the most prevalent concerns I have heard through the first and second year of university was students struggling to get a good grasp of the large code bases at their companies.</p>

</p>

<p>This is a page from Julia Evan's <a href="https://jvns.ca/wizard-zine.pdf">zine</a> outlining the tips to navigate large codebases. </p>
<p>While listening to Julia's recommendations, I though about the trick which I also frequently use when debugging, which is tracing though the logic flow of the problem. Suppose there is an issue reported by a customer; they provide a succinct list of steps that lead to the problem. This provides a starting point, now trace through the code and understanding the logic of each function along the way can prove to be extremely beneficial. Although the process might be slightly tedious at times and may take a while but often slow and steady wins the race. <em>(Warning: Does not work at all with concurrency issues)</em></p>
<p>It was a real privilege to hear Julia Evans speak at the conference, her blog posts on Kubernetes and Docker greatly, greatly helped me with my previous internship. Having the opportunity to meet with her in person on the second day was great, and I profusely thanked for creating her website -- she is helping tons of eager, young technologists just like me! </p>
<p>A regret from day one of StarCon was that I didn't really get to hear as many talks, I very much changed that on Day 2 -- more about that later!</p>
