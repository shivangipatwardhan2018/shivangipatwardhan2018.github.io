        <h3>StarCon! Day 2</h3>
<p>After not getting a chance to attend many talks on Day 1, the main goal of Day 2 was to attend as many talks as possible! I would like to highlight below two talks that really stood out to me on a personal level. </p>
<p>The keynote on Day 2 was by <a href="https://safia.rocks">Safia Abdalla</a> a senior from Northwestern University, who is an avid open source contributor. Her talk stood out for multiple reasons, she is an extremely articulate public speaker, she had a powerful story to share and, most importantly, she talked about failure. Safia's story outlined her encounter with the darkness and prejudice within open-source community.</p>
<p>It is so rare for individuals to talk about failure. Social media is often filled with stories of accomplishments and successes, and it is extremely easy to underestimate and forget the effort behind each accomplishment. Walking down the hallway at my university, there are so many conversations about internships and full-time offers from large Silicon Valley companies but none about failure, because of the prevalent idea that failure means weakness. I have failed more times than I can count and there is no doubt that others have too, but the stigma of talking about struggles with an assignment, struggles with work and struggles with life in general are a larger hindrance to progress than failure itself.</p>
<p>The second talk, "Imagining a World with Ethereum" by <a href="https://github.com/anasant">Anastasia Santasheva</a>, was very in-tune with the hype around blockchain technology. The most common use of the Ethereum technology is currently cryptocurrency, but the talk was centered around other uses to the Ethereum technology such as creating a Virtual Machine, File Storage and most interestingly (for me) setting up and using IPFS, a peer-to-peer distributed web system.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://ipfs.io/#why">IPFS</a> allows users to host decentralized websites. The talk outlines a use of the IPFS service, during the Catalan independence referendum elections of 2017 in Spain. Generally, all the Election Day instructions are handled by the federal government of Spain. In this case, the Spanish government clearly did not wish to help out with this election; Using IPFS, would allow the Catalan government to continue to provide its citizens with all voting information and avoid censorship from the Spanish government by hosting the information on a peer-to-peer network. It was truly fascinating to hear this use of the blockchain technology, providing a means for society to revolt against censorship and governmental authority. </p>
<p>This talk really went hand-in-hand with a course I am taking this term, CS 492 - Social Implications of Computing. The class really forces everyone to apply the analytical to view social problems as opposed to solving algorithms (as we usually do). We are currently analyzing the impact of the internet on society and the developement of blockchain technology I think is really going to be fundamental to charting the future influence of the internet. </p>
<p>At the ever end of Day 2, I finally got to meet Julia Evans, it was soo great having the opportunity to speak to her for a few minutes and convey just how much her Kubernetes tutorials helped me during my internship last year!</p>
<p>Overall StarCon was a fascinating experience, I am so very blessed to have had the opportunity to be a part of the organizing the conference.</p>
<p>P.S We got featured on the local <a href="https://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/mobile/video?binId=1.1147281">news</a>, start at 38 mins!  </p>
